# Core Banking Application Architecture


## Overview
This repository contains the architectural design for a **Core Banking Application**. The system is designed to be **scalable, secure, and highly available**, ensuring seamless financial transactions and data integrity.

This project will be modified as the next assignment will build and improve on what we have here now.

## Architecture Components
- **DNS Server**: Routes traffic efficiently to the application.
- **Load Balancer**: Distributes incoming requests across multiple servers to ensure high availability.
- **Databases**: Stores transactional data securely.
- **In-Memory Cache**: Improves performance by reducing database queries.
- **Application Servers**: Handles business logic and processing.
- **Web Server**: Serves static content and API requests.
- **Message Broker**: Manages asynchronous communication between services.
- **Notification Service**: Sends alerts and notifications.
- **Fraud Detection Service**: Enhances security by detecting fraudulent activities.
- **Logging and Auditing**: Ensures compliance and system monitoring.
- **Data Center 1 (DC1) & Data Center 2 (DC2)**: Provides redundancy and disaster recovery.

## Architecture Evaluation

### ‚úÖ Strengths
- **Scalability**: Load balancing and message queuing ensure smooth scaling.
- **High Availability**: Multi-data center setup with failover mechanisms.
- **Security**: Fraud detection and logging improve compliance.
- **Efficient Processing**: Caching and message queues optimize performance.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Areas for Improvement
1. **Backup & Recovery**: Implement automated backups and geo-redundant storage.
2. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Introduce automated deployment for faster releases.
3. **Observability & Monitoring**: Add tools like Prometheus, ELK.
4. **Cost Optimization**: Consider cloud auto-scaling to reduce idle infrastructure costs.

## Architecture Analysis Based on Requirements

| Requirement               | Status  | Comments |
|---------------------------|---------|----------|
| **Handling Traffic**      | ‚úÖ       | Load Balancer ensures distribution |
| **Data Storage**          | ‚úÖ       | Supports text, images, and files |
| **Scaling**               | ‚úÖ       | Auto-scaling enabled with caching |
| **Latency**               | ‚úÖ‚ö†Ô∏è     | Cache helps, but DB optimizations needed |
| **Uptime**                | ‚úÖ       | Multi-data center redundancy |
| **Throughput**            | ‚úÖ       | Message broker optimizes request processing |
| **Failover**              | ‚úÖ       | Automatic failover between DC1 & DC2 |
| **High Availability**     | ‚úÖ       | Redundant infrastructure |
| **Backup & Recovery**     | ‚ö†Ô∏è      | Needs automated backup strategy |
| **MTTR (Recovery Time)**  | ‚úÖ‚ö†Ô∏è     | Can be improved with auto-recovery using IaC tools like Terraform, Ansible |
| **Infrastructure Cost**   | ‚ö†Ô∏è      | Consider cloud-based auto-scaling |
| **Security & Compliance** | ‚úÖ‚ö†Ô∏è     | Add encryption & access controls |
| **Integration**           | ‚úÖ       | Message broker supports microservices |
| **Transaction Integrity** | ‚úÖ       | ACID-compliant database transactions |
| **Mobile & Web Support**  | ‚úÖ       | API Gateway recommended |
| **Release Frequency**     | ‚ö†Ô∏è      | Implement CI/CD pipeline |
| **Observability**         | ‚ö†Ô∏è      | Improve logging & monitoring |

## Recommendations
- **Enhance observability** using **Prometheus, ELK**.
- **Automate backups** with snapshots and geo-redundant storage.
- **Implement a CI/CD pipeline** for frequent and smooth deployments.
- **Optimize cloud infrastructure costs** using auto-scaling.
